#MPU-6050-with-servos
Simple test with three servos and a MPU6050

SOFTWARE SETTINGS ->For the code work, you should get the libraries on used_libraries folder and put them on folder libraries of your Arduino IDE.

HARDWARE SETTINGS ->MPU6050 SDA goes to Arduino SDA pin ->MPU6050 SCL goes to Arduino SCL pin ->MPU6050 GND goes to GND of your power GND ->MPU6050 5v (or 3.3v) goes to your power 5v (or 3.3v)

OBS: Check your Arduino board to know the SDA and SCL pins.
